# Instructions
To install, copy to a location somewhere and 'npm install'

Edit index.js to change the listener to something (maybe I'll make this CLI arguments at some point?)

Fire up a browser, navigate to IP/port of your choice:

http://localhost:3000/

You will be prompted for credentials to use on the SSH server via WebSocket.
